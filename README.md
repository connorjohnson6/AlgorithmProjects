# Algorithm Projects in Java

## Overview
This repository contains algorithm implementations created for a Java algorithms class. The projects demonstrate fundamental algorithmic concepts through hands-on coding and personal research. Each project focuses on different aspects of data structures and algorithms, with a strong emphasis on understanding the underlying processes.

## Projects

### Lab0
- **Beginning outline for LaTeX documents**: Preparation of documentation templates for algorithm write-ups.

### Lab1
- **Singly-Linked-List with own Stack/Queue**: Implementation of singly linked lists alongside custom stack and queue data structures.

### Lab2
- **Sorting Algorithms with Knuth Shuffle**: Exploration of various sorting algorithms, including the incorporation of the Knuth shuffle for randomness.

### Lab3
- **Linear and Binary Search/Hash Table with Chaining**: Implementation of search algorithms and hash tables with chaining to resolve collisions.

### Lab4
- **Undirected Graph / Binary Search Tree**: Study and implementation of fundamental graph algorithms on undirected graphs and binary search trees.

## Learning Outcomes
During the semester, the focus was on the fundamental processes of basic algorithmic principles. The hands-on approach required us to implement the code and actively research to expand our knowledge base.

## Contents
Each directory in this repository corresponds to a lab and contains:

- Java implementation files.
- A comprehensive write-up explaining the purpose and functionality of each class within the projects.

## Usage
To run these projects, you will need a Java development environment set up. Each lab folder contains all the necessary Java files. Compile and run the files within your IDE or command line tool to see the algorithms in action.

## Contributions
Feedback and contributions are welcome. Please feel free to fork, submit pull requests, or create issues for any bugs or improvements you identify.
