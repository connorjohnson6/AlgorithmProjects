Now that all files can be reviewed, it is important to review parts of the code essential to completing this project. Below will be breakdowns of key components of the \verb|sortingAlgorithms|, \verb|searchingAlgorithm|, and \verb|hashing| methods used inside of \verb|mainProgram.java|.

\pagebreak
 
\begin{large}
    1.) quickSort() method (\verb|sortingAlgorithms.java|)
\end{large}


\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|sortingAlgorithms.java| section, we construct the quick sort method (Lines: 150-192):

\begin{verbatim}
public static int quickSort(ArrayList<String> shuffledQuickList, int lowI, 
int highI){
    int comparisons = 0;

    if (lowI >= highI){
        return comparisons;
    }

    int pivotIndex = highI;
    String pivot = shuffledQuickList.get(pivotIndex);

    int leftP = lowI;
    int rightP = highI-1;

    while (leftP <= rightP) {
        while (leftP <= rightP && shuffledQuickList.get(leftP).compareTo(pivot) 
        < 0) {
            leftP++;
            comparisons++;
        }
        while (leftP <= rightP && shuffledQuickList.get(rightP).compareTo(pivot) 
        > 0) {
            rightP--;
            comparisons++;
        }
        if (leftP < rightP) {
            String temp = shuffledQuickList.get(leftP);
            shuffledQuickList.set(leftP, shuffledQuickList.get(rightP));
            shuffledQuickList.set(rightP, temp);
        }
    }
    String temp = shuffledQuickList.get(leftP);
    shuffledQuickList.set(leftP, shuffledQuickList.get(highI));
    shuffledQuickList.set(highI, temp);

    comparisons += quickSort(shuffledQuickList, lowI, leftP - 1);
    comparisons += quickSort(shuffledQuickList, leftP + 1, highI);


    return comparisons;
}	
\end{verbatim}
\item the \verb|quickSort()| method consists of two lists(\verb|leftP| and \verb|rightP|), one containing elements smaller than the pivot element and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. The two lists are then sorted recursively using a new pivot inside of the list until the entire list is sorted. Quick sort has a time complexity of \verb|O(n log n)|, which is faster than the rest of the algorithms due to its ability to handle larger lists. The importance of using this algorithm is so due to the fact that for a linear and a binary search to work properly, you would need the the list you work with to be sorted\\

\end{itemize}


\begin{large}
    2.) linearSearching() method (\verb|searchingAlgorithms.java|)
\end{large}


\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|searchingAlgorithms.java| section, we construct the linear searching method (Lines: 6-21):

\begin{verbatim}
public static void linearSearching(ArrayList<String> sortedList, ArrayList<String> randomSelect) {
    
    //refrenced by https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/
    
    int randomSize = randomSelect.size();
    int sortedSize = sortedList.size();
    int count = 0;
    double totalComparisons = 0.0; //allows for a new comparison per iteration
    
    for(int i = 0; i < randomSize; i++){ //iterate through the list of 42 Strings
        for(int j = 0; j < sortedSize; j++){ //iterate through th entire magic items
            count++;
            if(randomSelect.get(i).equals(sortedList.get(j))){	
                printResult(randomSelect.get(i), j, count);					
                totalComparisons += count;
                break;
            }
        }
        //reset the counter so that comparisons don't overlap
        count = 0;
    }
    double averageComparisons = totalComparisons / randomSize;
    printAverage(averageComparisons);
}
\end{verbatim}
\item the \verb|linearSearching()| method finds a target value in a list or an array by sequentially checking each element in the list or array-list until the target value is found or the end of the list is reached. The linear search time complexity is O(n)\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\begin{large}
    3.) binarySearching() method (\verb|searchingAlgorithms.java|)
\end{large}


\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|searchingAlgorithms.java| section, we construct the binary searching method (Lines: 32-62):

\begin{verbatim}
public static void binarySearching(ArrayList<String> sortedList, ArrayList<String> randomSelect) {

    //Referenced by https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-to-search-arraylist-element-using-binary-search/ 
    
    int randomSize = randomSelect.size();
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < randomSize; i++) {
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = sortedList.size() - 1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            count++;
            int compare = randomSelect.get(i).compareTo(sortedList.get(mid));
            //ignore left half
            if (compare < 0) {
                high = mid - 1;
            //ignore right half
            } else if (compare > 0) {
                low = mid + 1;
            //if neither then it is in the middle
            } else {
                printResult(randomSelect.get(i), mid, count);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    double averageComparisons = (double)count / randomSize;
    printAverage(averageComparisons);
}
\end{verbatim}
\item the \verb|binarySearching()| method repeatedly divides half the portion of the array-list that could contain the target element until the target element is found or the search space is exhausted.  The binary search time complexity is O(log n)\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\begin{large}
    4.) hashSearching() method (\verb|searchingAlgorithms.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|searchingAlgorithms.java| section, we construct the hash searching method (Lines: 65-93):

\begin{verbatim}
public static void hashSearching(int[] randomHashValues) {

    final int LINES_IN_FILE = 666;
    final int HASH_TABLE_SIZE = 250;
    
    // Sort the hash values.
    Arrays.sort(randomHashValues);
    
    int randomSize = randomHashValues.length;
    int arrayIndex = 0;
    int numComparisons = 0; // initialize the counter variable
    double totalComparisons = 0.0; //allows for a new comparison per iteration
    
    for (int i = 0; i < HASH_TABLE_SIZE; i++) {
        numComparisons++;
        while ((arrayIndex < LINES_IN_FILE) && (randomHashValues[arrayIndex] < i)) { 
            arrayIndex++;
            numComparisons++;
        }
        while ((arrayIndex < LINES_IN_FILE) && (randomHashValues[arrayIndex] == i)) {
            arrayIndex++;
            totalComparisons += numComparisons; // increment the counter for each comparison made in the while loop
            numComparisons = 0;
        }
    }
    
    double averageComparisons = totalComparisons / randomSize;
    printAverage(averageComparisons);
}
\end{verbatim}
\item the \verb|hashSearching()| method, we are using our 42 randomly selected items from the magicitems.txt and creating a hash value from it. Once we have the hash value, we compare those 42, just like the rest of the searches, to our 666 items inside of magic items, but this time from its hash value. From that, you will run into items that also have the same hash values, which is where chaining comes into play. Unfortunately for me, I do not think I coded the search correctly. However, I know that the step before analyzing the hash values is correctly implemented\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\begin{large}
    5.) printresults() method (\verb|searchingAlgorithms.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|searchingAlgorithms.java| section, we construct the printresults method (Lines: 97-103):

\begin{verbatim}
	public static void printResult(String value, int index, int count) {
		System.out.println(value + " found at index " + index + " (took " + count + " comparisons)");
	}
	
	public static void printAverage(double averageComparisons) {
		System.out.println("Average number of comparisons: " + String.format("%.2f", averageComparisons));
	}
\end{verbatim}
\item the \verb|printresults()| method, all we are doing here is organizing the prints so that the code is not messy with \verb|System.out.print()| methods\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak

\begin{large}
    6.) makeHashCode() method (\verb|hashing.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|hashing.java| section, we construct the makeHashCode method (Lines: 9-26):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    private static final int LINES_IN_FILE = 666;
    private static final int HASH_TABLE_SIZE = 250;

    public static int makeHashCode(String str) {
        str = str.toUpperCase();
        int length = str.length();
        int letterTotal = 0;

        // Iterate over all letters in the string, totalling their ASCII values.
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        char thisLetter = str.charAt(i);
        int thisValue = (int)thisLetter;
        letterTotal = letterTotal + thisValue;

        }

        // Scale letterTotal to fit in HASH_TABLE_SIZE.
        int hashCode = (letterTotal * 1) % HASH_TABLE_SIZE;  

        System.out.println(hashCode);
        return hashCode;
    }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

\item the \verb|makeHashCode()| method is simply taking the string from the magicitems.txt files and converting each character to its ASCII value. From that, you have to add up those ASCII values and module it by the desired size of your hash table.\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\begin{large}
    7.) analyzeHashValues() method (\verb|hashing.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}
\item Inside of \verb|hashing.java| section, we construct the analyzeHashValues method (Lines: 28-57):
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
        public static void analyzeHashValues(int[] hashValues) {
    
        // Sort the hash values.
        Arrays.sort(hashValues);
    
        int asteriskCount = 0;
        int[] bucketCount = new int[HASH_TABLE_SIZE];
        int totalCount = 0;
        int arrayIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < HASH_TABLE_SIZE; i++) {
            System.out.format("%03d ", i);
            asteriskCount = 0;
            while ((arrayIndex < LINES_IN_FILE) && (hashValues[arrayIndex] == i)) {
                System.out.print("*");
                asteriskCount = asteriskCount + 1;
                arrayIndex = arrayIndex + 1;
            }
            System.out.print(" ");
            System.out.println(asteriskCount);
            bucketCount[i] = asteriskCount;
            totalCount = totalCount + asteriskCount;
        }
    
    }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

\item the \verb|analyzeHashValues()| method is used to show how many hashed-valued items from magicitems.txt have the same hashed value. You can see by the print statements that we show this by the * character. An important list inside of this is the bucketCount[] as its the list that organizes what hashed-valued item has the same hash value.\\

\end{itemize}

\pagebreak
\begin{large}
    8.) main() method (\verb|mainProgram.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}

\item Inside of \verb|mainProgram.java| section, we construct the main method (Lines: 12-76)

\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        final int LINES_IN_FILE = 666;
        final String FILE_NAME = "/Users/Johnson_code/CJohnson-435-1/Lab3/textFiles/magicitems.txt";

            int index = 0;
            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
                String line = scanner.nextLine();
                magicItems[index] = line;
                index++;
                arrayList.add(line.toUpperCase());
            }

            int low = 0;
            int high = arrayList.size() - 1;
            ArrayList<String> sortedList = sortingAlgorithms.quickSort(arrayList, low, high);
            
            //must make a copy of the sortedList as we delete indexs in the randomied picked list
            ArrayList<String> sortedArrayList = new ArrayList<>(sortedList);

            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        
    }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

\item the \verb|main()| method is where I read off each line inside of magicitems.txt and include it into an array(used to implement the hash methods properly) and an array list(used to implement the linear and binary search properly). Followed by that, we collect our random 42 items used for each part of the assignment and then acquire the hash code for the 666 items from magicitems.txt and from our random 42 items.\\

\end{itemize}

\begin{large}
     9.) printStatements() method (\verb|mainProgram.java|)
\end{large}

\begin{itemize}

\item Inside of \verb|mainProgram.java| section, we construct the print statements method (Lines: 78-94):

\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    public static void printStatements(ArrayList<String>sortedArrayList, ArrayList<String> randomSelect, int[] hashValues, int[] randomhashValues) {

        System.out.println("-----------------------------");
        searchingAlgorithm.hashSearching(randomhashValues);
    }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}

\item the \verb|main()| method is another simple organizations print method so that our code isn't filled with \verb|System.out.print()| methods.\\

\end{itemize}

\begin{large}
    Recorded Results
\end{large}
\end{center}



After reviewing the code of both searches, it is now important to review the output produced by both searching methods\\

As you look at the results, you can see that the time complexity of a binary search is O(log n), and the time complexity of a linear search is O(n). With this information, we can assume that when the array size increases, the binary search continuously gets significantly better than the linear search. This is due to the binary search constantly splitting its list in half to find its desired index rather than a linear search which searches through the array one index at a time; as noted before, once an array gets larger, the linear search slows in speed.\\

In regards to the hash and chaining. you should be looking for O(n). However, mine is currently shown to be incorrect and has an asymptotic running time of \verb|O(n^2)|.
